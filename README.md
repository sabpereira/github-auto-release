## :wrench: How to use - GitHub releases

> **_NOTE:_** Make sure environment variables `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `REPO` are set.
For GitHub tokens see: [Github tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens).

:memo: When setting `REPO` env var don't forget to add the owner as in `belvo-finance/<repo-name>`, you'll get a 404 error otherwise.

:speaking_head: If you have **changed your GitHub user**, as we've done with the new users `@blv-<username>`, you may encounter problems using this tool. Remember that you will need to genereate a new `GITHUB_TOKEN` and update the env var.

Run `new-release` followed by the desired version bump type: `major`, `minor`, `patch`. 

For example, the following will allow you to create tag bumped by a minor version:

```bash
$ new-release minor
```

### Target commitish option

The default commitish value where the Git tag is created from is the `master` branch. To specify a different commitish value, run with the `--target_commitish` option. For example:

```bash
$ new-release minor --target_commitish eb6bc2c21ff896f159da74608f0a96330419a3g5
```
### Changelog formatting for GitHub release descriptions

Release descriptions are automatically generated based on the commits created and their messages, organized by types of changes.
We are using [keep a changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) as a reference for the types of changes and their definitions.

For proper formatting of the changelog descriptions, all commits to master should be formatted as follows:

```markdown
[LABEL] MESSAGE
```
Where "LABEL" is one of the valid types of changes listed below:
* **[Added]** for new features.
* **[Changed]** for changes in existing functionality.
* **[Deprecated]** for soon-to-be removed features.
* **[Removed]** for now removed features.
* **[Fixed]** for any bug fixes.
* **[Security]** in case of vulnerabilities.
* **[Migrations]** for database migrations(need to be stand alone).
* **[Other]** for all other changes (or mislabeled changes).

Any commit message that is missing a label or improperly labeled will be automatically labeled as **[Other]**.
